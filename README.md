# A Priority Queue for a Simplified Agenda Manager in a Rule-Based Expert System Shell

## Description
   The two basic elements of a rule-based expert system shell are a knowledge base and an inference engine. The knowledge base contains the domain knowledge in the form of rules. The inference engine uses these rules to produce a solution to a given problem.The inference engine operates in cycles. In each cycle, it first determines which rules can be activated for firing (called activated rules), then selects one rule for execution and finally executes the selected rule. Each activated rule has a corresponding priority. An agenda containsa list of activated rules, with their priorities, maintained by an agenda manager. In each cycle, an agenda manager updates list of activated rules by adding new activated rules and deleting rulesthat are no longer activated and the rule that was executed in a previous cycle.
